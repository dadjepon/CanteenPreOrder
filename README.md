 _CanteenPreorder: Streamlining Food Ordering at Canteens_

## Project Overview

Our goal is to transform the meal ordering experience in Ashesi campus canteens. 
CanteenPreorder is a software solution that allows students and faculty to preorder meals, 
lowering wait times and increasing convenience. CanteenPreorder seeks to create a seamless and 
efficient meal ordering procedure for students and faculty by including features like push alerts
when food is ready, menu changes, and support for mobile money (MoMo) billing.

## TODO (Key, high level functionalities to be implemented)

1. Establish a preordering system to expedite the meal ordering procedure at Ashesi campus 
canteens.
2. Ensure that clients have access to the most recent information about available selections by 
providing real-time changes to the menu.
3. Allow invoicing using mobile money (MoMo) for safe and easy payment transactions.
4. Constantly improve CanteenPreorder based on insightful input from stakeholders and 
users.
